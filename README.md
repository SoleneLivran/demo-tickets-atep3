# demo-tickets-atep3
Demo version - a simple tool created for a drama association, to create the tickets for their festival's shows

Personal project<br>
HTML · CSS · BOOTSTRAP · PHP<br>
Project done after about a month of learning programming, in june 2020, in response to the needs of the ATEP3 association.

ATEP3 is a small student association in Paris, organizing each year a 2 week long festival. The Festival A Contre Sens is about 50 free shows, with around 3000 spectators. The tickets were previously made "by hand" with InDesign, which not everyone knew how to use.<br>
It was important to develop a simple tool, usable by any team member even with no technical knowledge.

The information about the show are filled in a form.<br>
Sending the form generates nominative tickets, based on the spectators list filled in the form.<br>
The tickets are made for printing ; their final look is seen after a PDF export.

This app was made to work in Google Chrome.<br>
This is my very first personal project, coded alone in vanilla PHP ; it would probably deserves to be re-made with new knowledge I gained later ;)
